# Google Kickstart 2018 Round G


### Why Python?
Because I have been coding in Python. The intermediate results are saved and be easily be shown to other people. Moreover I am not yet in the business of optimising yet. I am not sure for Google Kickstart/CodeJam but I know that Hackerrank allow more run time for files written in Python.

The use of Python was an issue in a recent coding challenge at Credit Suisse. Python was slow, which is suspect is due to all the deepcopy that needs to be made. Someday, I need to have some understanding of C++ does. 


# On the use of code from the Internet

From https://code.google.com/codejam/resources/faq:

> During the round, can I use code written before the round?
> As long as you have a license to use it, yes. That means you can write your own helper code, or collect your own personal library of code, as long as the license terms of the code permit it. Some Code Jam contestants will have competed on an ACM ICPC team, and many of those teams have their own code books; check with your team's coach whether it's permissible for you to use that code in a different context.

I guess I will simply use what I can find on the Internet for this competition. I should be expected to write from functions like sort algorithms from scratch.

Sometimes the code from the Internet is faulty as well. "ABB" and "BAB" are anagrams of each other, but https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-two-strings-are-anagram-of-each-other/ detects otherwise.
